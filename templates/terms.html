                <h3>2. Description of Service</h3>
                <p>BookerAI provides a scheduling and booking platform for independent service providers ("Providers").
                    We are a technology platform, not a service provider.</p>

                <h3>3. Eligibility</h3>
                <p>You must be at least 18 years old to use this Service. By creating an account, you represent that you

                <h3>5. Provider Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>Providers are independent contractors and not employees of BookerAI. Providers are solely responsible
                    for:</p>

                <h3>7. Cancellations and Refunds</h3>
                <p>Cancellation policies and refunds are determined by the individual Provider. BookerAI does not manage
                    or issue refunds for services rendered by Providers.</p>

                <h3>8. Payments</h3>
                <p>Payments are processed securely via Stripe. BookerAI does not store full credit card details on its
                    servers.</p>

                <h3>9. Communications Consent</h3>

                    notifications, related to your bookings and account updates. Message and data rates may apply.</p>
